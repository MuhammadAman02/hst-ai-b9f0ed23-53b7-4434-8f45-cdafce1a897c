From your request, I understand that you want me to implement the design and functionality shown in the PDF. Let's break down the features and create a beautiful, functional app that matches the design.\n\nHere's what I envision based on the PDF:\n\n1. A sleek, modern design with a dark theme\n2. A header with a logo and navigation menu\n3. A main content area with a search bar and a grid of movie posters\n4. Movie posters with hover effects showing additional information\n5. A responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes\n\nLet's implement these features with a focus on creating a visually appealing and user-friendly movie browsing experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, let's create the main components:\n\n\n\n\nimport React from 'react';\n\nconst SearchBar: React.FC = () => {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"w-full max-w-2xl mx-auto mb-8\">\n      <input\n        type=\"text\"\n        placeholder=\"Search for movies...\"\n        className=\"w-full px-4 py-2"
